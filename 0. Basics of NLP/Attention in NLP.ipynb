    "In NLP (Natural Language Processing), attention is a mechanism that allows models to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when processing or generating output, rather than treating all parts equally. It helps the model weigh the importance of different words or tokens based on their relevance to the task, such as translation, summarization, or question answering."

    "Cross-Attention: A token in one sequence (e.g., target) attends to tokens in another sequence (e.g., source), common in encoder-decoder models.\n",
